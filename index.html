<img src="sketch.jpg" width="50%">

<h3>Key Observations</h3>
<p>- User 1 tried to put a pack of soda cans into the fridge but the package was too big.
    Therefore, User 1 needed to take the soda cans out of the package and put them in the fridge separately. </p>
<p>- User 2 took a cup of ice cream out of the freezer and ate it. The texture of the ice cream is too hard for him
        to eat right away. He needs to leave it out for about 5 minutes before eating.</p>
<p>- User 3 took his stored foods from the fridge and put it in the microwave that is placed on the fridge before eating.</p>
